# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Player vs Computer "Rock, paper, scissors" game, but with an option to include additional weapons.

Enter your name. If your name exist in ratings.txt file, you will start with bonus points (like if you have played before and you have 350 points, you can type your name and start where you left off). 
Unfortunately I did not add the option to update your score in that file. But you can do it manually if you want. New players will start with 0 points. Each draw gives 50 and wins give 100 points.

If you dont want to include additional weapons, just hit enter. Standart rock, paper and scissors. Enter an option and see what happens.
But if you want, you can add your specific weapons like that: "rock,scissors,paper,sword,gun,bomb". Don't forget to write comma after each weapon and don't use whitespaces. 

*IMPORTANT:* Optional weapons should be in order - rock > scissors > paper > sword > gun > bomb and then bomb > rock.

You can check score using !rating and stop the code using !exit.

*Have fun!*
